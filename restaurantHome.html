                    Some restaurants consider fresh seafood something that was just freshly defrosted 
                    from the freezer. That is not the case at the Calabash Waterfront Seafood Shack 
                    where we own the boats! Here is our example of FRESH FISH… Joe Schmidt from 
                    Charlotte, NC enjoys a half day, nearshore, morning charter trip aboard our famous 
                    Navigator (a Myrtle Beach deep sea fishing party boat) with his family. A beautiful 
                    day on the water and a beautiful bounty of flounder was caught by the family. When 
                    the boat returns to port, Joe walks his flounder a few feet to our Waterfront Seafood 
                    Shack and gives his flounder and instructions to the restaurant manager. Joe’s fresh 
                    catch of flounder is prepared as requested to perfection with some fillets Calabash 
                    style and southern deep fried, some filets are baked and one giant filet is pan seared 
                    in butter just the way Joe likes it! Now that is what we here at Calabash Waterfront 
                    Seafood Shack call FRESH FISH! BTW… They added some fresh shrimp and french fries to 
                    the platters just to top them off to perfection. Oh, did I mention we own the shrimp 
                    boat (Miss Serina) also.
